Dump entries to LDIF file

  The following example demonstrates how to use the LDAP Maven Plugin to dump directory
  contents to LDIF format after integration tests have been performed.

  * LDAP Directory Server

  In this example we are assuming that {{{http://directory.apache.org}Apache Directory Server}}
  is being used and is installed locally on port 10389 with the default admininstration account
  (uid=admin,ou=system) and password (secret). Furthermore, we are assuming that the base DN
  has not been modified from the default (o=sevenSeas).

  * Configure a POM

  Add the following configuration to your project POM to dump the data after test execution:
  
+-----+
<project>
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
        <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <phase>post-integration-test</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>ldif-dump</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <version>3</version>
              <host>localhost</host>
              <port>10389</port>
              <authDn>uid=admin,ou=system</authDn>
              <passwd>secret</passwd>
              <filename>dump.ldif</filename>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
